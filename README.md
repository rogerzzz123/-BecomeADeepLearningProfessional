" Done! You are using a brand new conda environment now. You’ll need to activate it every time you open a new terminal. Or if you’re a Windows or macOS user, you can open the corresponding Anaconda Prompt (it will show up as Anaconda Prompt (pytorchbook) in our case), which will have it activated from the start."
