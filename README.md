## - Conda Installation
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

## - Create Virtual Environment
- conda create -n pytorchbook anaconda
- conda activate pytorchbook

" Done! You are using a brand new conda environment now. You’ll need to activate it every time you open a new terminal. Or if you’re a Windows or macOS user, you can open the corresponding Anaconda Prompt (it will show up as Anaconda Prompt (pytorchbook) in our case), which will have it activated from the start." 

## Install Pytorch
"CUDA “is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs).”"

macOS: If you’re a macOS user, please beware that PyTorch’s binaries do not support CUDA. Meaning, you’ll need to install PyTorch from source if you want to use your GPU. This is a somewhat complicated process. As described in this link, if you don’t feel like it, you can choose to proceed without CUDA, and you’ll still be able to execute the code in this course promptly.

简单说一句话： mac local就别用gpu了 非常复杂 哪里能用cuda就在那里用gpu
